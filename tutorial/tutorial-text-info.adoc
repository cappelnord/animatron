== Text

All actors can display a single line of text.

If you create an actor with a non-existent animation, it will display the name of the actor instead of an animation.

But text can be added to actors that have animations as well, with the `/type` command.

Text can be trimmed with `/text/visible/ratio`. When set to `1` it will display the whole text. `0` will hide it. `0.5` will show half the first half of the text and hide the rest.
