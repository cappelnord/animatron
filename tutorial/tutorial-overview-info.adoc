== Overview

=== Actors

Everything in Animatron is an *actor*.

You put actors on the stage and send them commands to perform actions.

The most basic action is playing an image sequence, creating an animation.

=== Assets

An asset is the collection of images creating the image sequence; they are the frames.

To see a list of all the available assets, use the `/assets` command.
