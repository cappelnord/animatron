=== Play

First create the actor again with `/create`.

You can stop the animation with `/stop`.

Change the frame with `/frame`.

Or go frame by frame with `/next/frame` or `/prev/frame`.

And play it again with `/play`

Then play a range of frames with `/play/range`.

Change the playback speed with `/speed <actor> multiplier`. Setting it to `1` plays at normal speed. `0.5` plays at half speed and `2` doubles the play rate.

To play it wbackwards, set a negative `/speed` value.
