== move

Actors can be moved around with `/position <actor> <x_pixels> <y_pixels>`.

The top-left corner is `0` for both `x` and `y`. The bottom right is the window width and height, probably `x` being `1920` and `y` being `1080`.

To place it in the middle of the window, use `/center`.

To move it along one axis use either `/x` or `/y`

You can also move it relative to the current position with `/move`, `/move/x` and `/move/y`. Try executing the same move command several times. Compare it to the position commands.
