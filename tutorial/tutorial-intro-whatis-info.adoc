=== What is Animatron

Animatron is an experimental environment designed to improvise with image sequences in a live performance.

You can use it to create visuals by combining animations in real time, just like a musician would combine notes with an instrument to create music.

There's plenty of full-featured software for generating visuals in a live performance.

Nearly all of them, though, work at the pixel level using something called _shaders_.

Animatron, on the other hand, uses the image sequence as the building block.

The former are to visuals what an audio synthesizer is to music, while Animatron would be more of a sampler.
