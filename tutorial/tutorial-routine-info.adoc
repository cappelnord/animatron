= routine

The `/routine` command allows calling one command more than once over a period of time.


You need to give it a name (so it can be cancelled at any time), a number of repeats and the interval of time -in seconds- at which you want the repeats to happen (use `inf` to repeat it for ever). Then you specify the command you want to be repeated.

`/routine <name> <repeats> <interval> <cmd>`

To stop a routine use `/routine/free <name>`.
