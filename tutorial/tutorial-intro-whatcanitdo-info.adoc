=== What can Animatron do?

If you have ever done any animation, you know it takes a crazy amount of time and work, and it's completely unthinkable to do it as a performing art.

With some preparation, Animatron allows you to do exactly that: perform as an animator.

All you need is a few image sequences and some way to control the software, which can be done in many ways, although it was initially developed with live coding in mind.

You could "play" it with a MIDI keyboard, as an image piano, so to speak.

Or with the motion sensors of your phone.

It can also be used collaboratively, with many users controling it at the same time, or cross-controling many Animatron instances in a multi-user setup.

I use it as my go-to slideshow engine when I give workshops.

Actually, this tutorial is done with Animatron itself :)
