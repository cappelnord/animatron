=== What can Animatron do?

It can create a collage of animations, which you can then modify in real time.

You could "play" it with a MIDI keyboard, as an image piano, so to speak.

Or with the motion sensors of your phone.

It can also be used collaboratively, with many users controlling it at the same time, or cross-controling many Animatron instances in a multi-user setup.

You can use it to present a slideshow.

This tutorial is done with Animatron itself :)
