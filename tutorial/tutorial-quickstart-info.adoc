== Quick Start

NOTE: Whenever you get lost, because this text goes away, execute the line at the top of the editor to get back to it.

First of all you need to load some image sequences.

To see the list of available animations, use `/animations`.

It's probably empty. That's because we haven't loaded any, yet.

To see the list of avaiable animations for loading, use `/assets`.

Choose one and load it with `/load <name>`.

If all went well, excuting `/animations` now should display one item in the list with the number of frames of the animation between parenthesis `()`.

Now let's create an actor named `lola` with this animation using `/create <actor-name> <animation-name>`.

You should see an animation running.

To remove it from the stage use `/clear <name>`.
