== Wildcards

When creating actors with similar names, we can send commands to all of them using wildcards.

There are 2 wildcards:

- `*` matches any number of characters. E.g.: `a*o` will match both `alo` and `allo`.
- `?` matches exactly one character. E.g.: `a?o` will match both `alo` and `amo`, but not `allo`.
