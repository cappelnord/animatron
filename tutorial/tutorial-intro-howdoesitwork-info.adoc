=== How does it work?

Everything in Animatron is done using *commands*.

You can write them in the editor or send them from other software or devices in the same network using OSC messages.

See the full <<help.adoc#,list>> of available commands.

==== Custom commands

Custom commands can be defined to create complex behaviours out of other commands.

We call these custom commands *defs*, for _definition_.

Defs are created with the `/def` command.
