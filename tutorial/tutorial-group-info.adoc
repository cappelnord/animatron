Commands can be executed in bulk with wildcards.

Create a bunch of actors with similar names, then use a wildcard to send a command to all of them.

When using  `/rand` with wildcards, it will send a different value to each actor.

`*` will match any number of characters.
`?` will match exactly one character (which can be anything).
