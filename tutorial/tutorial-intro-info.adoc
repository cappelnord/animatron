== Introduction

To use animatron you send it *commands*.

A *command* is a message with an instruction, which may need parameters.

In the editor is a list of commands that will let you navigate this section.

NOTE: If you get lost because this text goes away, execute the command at the very top.

To execute a command put the cursor anywhere on a line of your choice and press kbd:[shift + enter].

Blocks of commands (delimited by empty lines) can also be executed with kbd:[ctrl + enter].

Try executing the commands listed in the editor.

Lines beginning with a pound sign (#) will be ignored. These are comments.

When you are finished, execute the last command which will lead you to the next section.
