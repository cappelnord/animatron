# Animatron

**Animatron** is an experimental environment (very much "work in
progress") that enables creation of "visual poetry," in the form of
animations and images, created in real-time through live coding.  It
implemented using the open-source [Godot
engine](https://godotengine.org/), and communicates with any "client"
application or live coding language &mdash; such as
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) &mdash; via the
network, using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol.

This repo is a remake of [Animatron](https://github.com/loopier/animatron-godot3) for Godot 4.x and above. It's still in a very unstable version.

Trying to build a pseudo live coding language using OSC (OCL - Open Control Language?).
